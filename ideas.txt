ideas
------------------
you fight when you come into contact with another player.

if it was zombie tag. i
basic rules..
pros: no one is ever out, math is only done in battle and not when moving.
join in middle your it.
game auto restarts when everyone is caught.
maybe be able to say no to a battle....
only ask math when you battle someone...
this would eliminate having to do math and move at same time.
you can only fight one person at a time....
battle results obviously should be saved in db. 
you will still get belts like other game...
last person with no defeats is the champion of that game....
if you join late you are not eligible for champion but you can still battle.
ability to send canned messages.....
play up the belts because some kids will have trouble winning battles but will get prestige by gaining belts....
